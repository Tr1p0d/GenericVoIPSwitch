SIP is layered protocol :
	The lowest layer of SIP is its syntax and encoding.
	
	The second layer is the transport layer.  It defines how a client
   	sends requests and receives responses and how a server receives
   	requests and sends responses over the network.

	The transaction layer
   	has a client component (referred to as a client transaction) and a
   	server component (referred to as a server transaction), each of which
   	are represented by a finite state machine that is constructed to
   	process a particular request.
	
	The layer above the transaction layer is called the transaction user
   	(TU).  Each of the SIP entities, except the stateless proxy, is a
   	transaction user.  When a TU wishes to send a request, it creates a
   	client transaction instance and passes it the request along with the
   	destination IP address, port, and transport to which to send the
   	request.
